description=[h1]What does this mod ?[/h1]
description=The goal of this mod is to make the two mods [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3006143351]Cordyceps Spore Zones[/url] from Braven and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2795677303]Susceptible[/url] from Spyjack work together. It is partially inspired by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3035924033]TLOU Enhanced Experience[/url] from Monkey which is broken at the time of writing this.

description=[u][b]Features:[/b][/u]
description=[olist]
description=[*]Uses the [b]list of masks and hazmat suits from Susceptible[/b] for more mod compatibilities. (such as respirators from STALKER armor pack or gasmasks from Undead Survivor)
description=
description=[*]Only masks with [b]filters[/b] or [b]oxygen tanks[/b] work in the spore zones ! If you have a protection, you are [b]100% safe[/b] from spore zones !
description=
description=[*][b]Durability consumption[/b] of filters and oxygen tanks in spore zones.
description=
description=[*]Doesn't consume durability outside of spore zones.
description=
description=[*]Sandbox options to customize the time to drain the durability !
description=
description=[*]Ability to [b]remove the Susceptible trait[/b] from character creation with a secondary mod ! 
description=
description=[*]The [b]mask UI[/b] from Susceptible shows you when you are [b]in danger[/b] in a spore zone ! But [b]moodles[/b] can still help you identify your level of danger in a spore zone !

description=You are [b]in a spore zone without any protection[/b] ! You will [b]get infected[/b] if you don't get out now !
description=
description=The time for infection depends on the settings of the original Spore Zone mod and can be changed in the sandbox options. You will also become sick when in the spore zone without a protection, it's a neat indicator that you can also use.

description=This means you are [b]not[/b] in a spore zone and [b]don't have a gasmask or hazmat equiped[/b]. Make sure you equip one of those before going in a spore zone ! 
description=
description=You can [b]find a gasmask or hazmat[/b] to protect yourself on [b]various zombies[/b] or you can [b]loot it[/b] in some places. But don't forget the [b]filter or oxygen tank[/b] or it won't work ![/td]

description=
description=The durability of the protection is [b]only drained in spore zones[/b] so you can stay cool and styled with your gasmask even outside without draining your protection's durability.

description=[h1]Remarks[/h1]
description=If you have any suggestions, or mods that need their compatibility added (masks, hazmats etc), feel free to share those and I'll look into it.
description=
description=Spyjack's and Braven's codes felt very clean and those look very bugproof, and since I used those almost entirely, I feel like bugs that appear will probably be results of those or mod incompatibilites. However it is definitely possible some issues can appear.
